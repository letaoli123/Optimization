# Optimization

In this project, I researched the various types of optimization problems in operations research. I specifically focused on the knapsack problem, which consists of optimizing the total value of objects inside a container while respecting weight limits or volume limits.

In this project I used Google OR Tools, which is a software suite for python that contains solvers for all types of knapsack problems. In this project, I emplemented two types of knapsack problems with two different constraints: the first problem could contain a whole number of items, and the second problem could contain a partial quantity of items.
